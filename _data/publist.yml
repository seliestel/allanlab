  description: "By focusing on the critical situation of elephants in Thailand, the essay shows the shortcomings of conventional ecocriticism and calls for an enlarged theoretical framework of analysis and criticism, one which would be able to take into consideration all the contexts where relevant meanings about the environment and its challenges are being produced, disseminated and interpreted."
